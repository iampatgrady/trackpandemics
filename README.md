# Track Pandemics  
This project supports pandemic research by warehousing anonymized vitals.  

## Plan
Make it easy to capture data in real time:
https://www.trackpandemics.com  

The data is publicly available in BigQuery:
[https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=pandemic-tracker](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=pandemic-tracker&d=public&t=hourly_export&page=table)  

Inspired by this serverless pixel service:

## Contribute
I'm new to open source and looking for guidance. Submit your PRs and I'll do my best to keep up.
